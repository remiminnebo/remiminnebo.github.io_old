My mission is to design and deliver cost-effective, high-performant cloud environments that address complex business problems by assessing current capabilities and designing future technology architectures. 

- I love everything Kubernetes!

After starting my IT carreer as a 1st line support engineer, I have evolved to a cloud architect role.
