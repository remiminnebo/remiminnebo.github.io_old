My mission is to design and deliver cost-effective, high-performant cloud environments that address complex business problems by assessing current capabilities and designing future technology architectures. Creating value for the customer is my main priority.

Some quotes that you might hear me repeat over and over:
- I love Kubernetes!
- If you can't measure it, it's a hobby!
- Make all things transparant!

In my spare time I like to stay up-to-date with latest news on technology, innovation & science.
